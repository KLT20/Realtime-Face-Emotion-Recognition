In this project, the goal is to identify what emotion a person is feeling by looking at a static pitcure or a real-time video of them.

The implementation of the paper DeepEmotion2019 is re-created, and it can be found on the following link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01019.pdf

A Youtube video that explains the step by step approach can be found on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN7qfBhfGqs&ab_channel=DeepLearning_by_PhDScholar

The FER2013 was downloaded from Kaggle,
